step 1: Open the terminal. It should be pointing to the directory of ur project 
step 2 : npx create-react-app frontend //run this command to create a react app
step 3: after creating, run npm start. The react logo will appear at ur webpage in the url localhost : 3000

while running some code, u may get vulnerabilities like a warning. The warning can be ignored, if u want to fix only do 
npm audit fix 
Do not go for fix --force as this makes react-scripts to 0.0.0 which will make u not able to run the react app

step 4 : in some step u woulf require to install react router dom so, 
npm install react-router-dom //this installs react router dom for navigation
